                                        <h3>1. Drone 720X - Take the flyest selfies ever</h3>

                                        <a href="https://hyperstech.com/intl_2/order.php?prod=drone&net=5530&aff={AFFID}&sid={SUBID}&cid={CLICKID}" target="_blank" class="thumbnail"><img src="images/maxresdefault.jpg" /></a>

                                        <p>Try to picture having a tiny drone inside your pocket and use it for a million ways you could ever imagine. Well, this idea is really happening. In fact, millions of people are swapping their selfie sticks for these cute and tiny drones. Take a look at my photo above. This just proves that selfie technology has been reaching new heights.</p>
                                        <p>This drone is foldable, lightweight and really unique. The Selfie Drone 720X is different from all the drones out there because anyone can use this. Anyone meaning even your great grandmother can use it. This drone is independent and can fly by themselves in several predetermined ways. It means that you can command the drone to follow you, to focus on you, or even just flying it around. You can even do all of this even when you are moving. The idea is simply telling the drone to follow you and capture your adventures. How cool is that?</p>
                                        <p>Now this would have easily made our list, but since it doesn’t meet our under $60 criterion we had to drop it. However we liked it so much, we had to add it in as a honorable mention. It’s the perfect gift for the Outdoorsy Adventurous person in your family.</p>

                                        <h3>2. iTrack - Simple and effective GPS Car Tracking Technology</h3>

                                        <a href="https://hyperstech.com/intl_2/order.php?prod=itrack&net=5530&aff={AFFID}&sid={SUBID}&cid={CLICKID}" target="_blank" class="thumbnail"><img src="images/car_tracking_system.jpg" /></a>

                                        <p>If you can think of any situation where you might want to know where your car is, or where it has been, then you might need a GPS car tracker. </p>
                                        <p>The main purpose of a GPS car tracking device is to let you know where your vehicle is at all times, and there are a lot of different scenarios where that can be helpful. For instance, if your car was stolen, but you had a tracker installed, you could provide the police with its exact location.</p>
                                        <p>GPS trackers for cars also fall directly in the rift between free-range parenting and authoritative parenting. With the right tracker installed in your teen’s car, you can pull up their location in real-time, or view a record of where they’ve been, when they were there, and even whether or not they broke the speed limit.</p>
                                        <p>Vehicle tracking devices are also tremendously useful for owners of large fleets of cars or trucks. Some use the technology to keep tabs on where their vehicles are at any given time to better coordinate daily operations, while others are more interested in tracking mileage for bookkeeping or reimbursement.</p>

                                        <h3>3. NeckRelax - Tired of neck pain? Immediate relief, wherever you are!</h3>

                                        <a href="https://hyperstech.com/intl_2/order.php?prod=neckrelax&net=5530&aff={AFFID}&sid={SUBID}&cid={CLICKID}" target="_blank" class="thumbnail"><img src="images/necrelax.jpg" /></a>

                                        <p>Neck pain is a common problem with few solutions. But thanks to The NeckRelax, that’s about to change. The NeckRelax brings the miracle of cervical traction to your home in the form of a simple, portable device you can use every day.</p>
                                        <p>It helps release muscle tension in as little as 10 minutes a day and for less than the cost of a single physical therapy session.</p>
                                        <p>if you have frequent neck pain or know someone who does, you know it’s not an easy problem to get rid of. Medications simply dull the pain but do not eliminate it. And visits to your physical therapist are costly and time-consuming. Other products have tried to bring neck pain relief home through cervical traction (a light stretching of the neck) but these devices are bulky, hard to operate and often ineffective.</p>
                                        <p>NeckRelax is the first affordable cervical traction device that does all the hard work for you. All you have to do is lie back and relax.</p>

                                        <h3>4. ClearView - Banish night driving fears for ever!</h3>

                                        <a href="https://hyperstech.com/intl_2/order.php?prod=clearview&net=5530&aff={AFFID}&sid={SUBID}&cid={CLICKID}" target="_blank" class="thumbnail"><img src="images/Prescription_Glasses_Night_Driving-750x410.jpg" /></a>

                                        <p>Seriously, did you know that the vast majority of car accidents happen at night and right before dawn? A lot of that has to do with glare and the problems with vision many people experience. Maybe that’s the reason these driving glasses are selling by the truckload. <u>Night Vision HD</u> promises to reduce night driving glare and eye strain, and it will dramatically improve seeing at night during snow or rainy conditions. <b><u>It lets you see enhanced color, is durable, lightweight and is fully equipped with polarized lenses.</u></b></p>
                                        <p>Unlike clip-ons it protects your eyes from all sides, and you can just slide it over your existing prescription lenses. Whether driving, reading or golfing, these versatile goggles make seeing a whole new experience.</p>

                                        <p>Have you ever gone to an auto repair shop for an oil change, only to have the mechanic say you need a new transmission? Or has the mysterious “check engine” light come on, and next thing you know the mechanic has a list of expensive engine parts that need replacing?</p>
                                        <p>Unfortunately, mechanics know taking advantage of people is easy, given their lack of knowledge about car maintenance needs. But there’s a new device you can carry with you in your car to tell you exactly what’s wrong with it. If you own a car built after 1996 then you can use this brilliant new device called SmartCar to instantly diagnose any car problems.</p>
                                        <p>This means the next time your “Check Engine Light” happens to come on, you’ll know exactly what the issue is and the Mechanics won’t be able to lie to you! This product has done over $50,000,000 in sales in 2020 so far, so it definitely qualifies for our viral products list.</p>

The perfect flashlight for emergency situations is the  TacticalX Flashlight. This was built to withstand anything!</p>
                                        <p>You might be thinking that you already have a flashlight. But do the Navy Seals and the Military rely on the kind of flashlight you have? The TacticalX Flashlight uses military-grade LED technology that can illuminate a field or blanket a work area with 800 lumens of light. It can also blind an attacker. The skin is tough aircraft-grade-aluminum. Throw it, drive over it—it’ll still work. Drop it in six feet of water—it’ll still work. This tough gadget is also versatile. It comes with a strobe setting if you are stranded and need to signal for help, and you can zoom and focus its LED beam to see far, far away.</p>
                                        <p>That makes it ideal for reliable, abundant light during a prolonged natural disaster or emergency…and for lots of everyday uses. This is standard gear if you want to be prepared for anything. Keep it in your car with you or your house.</p>
